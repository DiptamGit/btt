### Virtualization

#### What is Virtualization and What is its Main Idea?
Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, including but not limited to virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources. The main idea behind virtualization is to allow multiple virtual systems (or virtual machines) to run on a single physical system, sharing the underlying hardware resources. This improves efficiency, reduces costs, and simplifies resource management.

#### User and Kernel Modes
User mode and kernel mode are two different operating modes of a CPU. Kernel mode has full access to all hardware and can execute any CPU instruction. Operating systems run most of their processes in user mode to prevent applications from directly accessing hardware or memory, which increases system stability and security.

#### CPU Privilege Levels
CPU privilege levels, often referred to as rings, are mechanisms to protect data and functionality from faults (by faults in applications) and malicious behaviour. Ring 0 has the highest privilege and is where the kernel runs. Ring 3 is where user applications run with limited privileges.

#### Comparison between Different Types of Virtualizations
- **Full Virtualization** uses hardware features to emulate a complete hardware environment and execute guest code directly on the host's CPU.
- **Paravirtualization** guests are aware of the hypervisor and can thus cooperate with it for better performance.
- **OS-Level Virtualization** allows multiple isolated user-space instances, instead of simulating virtual hardware.

#### Definition of Each Type and Examples
- **Full Virtualization:** VMware ESXi, Oracle VM VirtualBox.
- **Paravirtualization:** Xen, VMware vSphere.
- **OS-Level Virtualization:** Docker, LXC.

#### Xen Main Concepts
Xen is a type-1 hypervisor providing services that allow multiple computer operating systems to execute on the same computer hardware concurrently. It does not require the host operating system but requires guest operating systems to be modified for paravirtualization.

#### Binary Translations
Binary translation is a technique used in virtualization that dynamically translates kernel code of a guest operating system into a form that can be executed on the host processor. It is essential in supporting unmodified guest OSs in full virtualization environments.

#### Hardware Virtualization and Its History
Hardware virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual machine that acts like a real computer with an operating system. Software executed on these virtual machines is separated from the underlying hardware resources. IBM was one of the pioneers in the 1960s with their mainframes.

### Containers

#### Operating System-Level Virtualization
Operating system-level virtualization, or containerization, is a virtualization type where the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances. These instances, often called containers, can run applications without launching an entire virtual machine for each app.

#### Examples of OS Virtualization
- **Linux Containers (LXC)**
- **Docker**

#### OS Virtualization and Containers
OS virtualization is the concept behind containers, which are isolated environments that share the host system's kernel but can have their own CPU, memory, I/O, etc.

#### Comparison between VMs and Containers
- **VMs:** Full OS on virtual hardware, more overhead, and longer startup times.
- **Containers:** Share OS, lighter, faster startup, less isolated.

#### Three Building Blocks of Containers
- **Container Runtime:** The environment in which containers are executed (e.g., Docker).
- **Container Orchestration:** Managing the lifecycles of containers, especially in large dynamic environments (e.g., Kubernetes).
- **Container Images:** Immutable files that include all dependencies needed to run an application.

### Docker

#### Union File System and Docker Images
Docker images use Union File Systems to layer changes, making them very lightweight and fast. Docker can download only layers that don't exist on the host.

#### Docker Architecture and its Components
- **Docker Daemon:** The background service running on the host that manages building, running, and distributing Docker containers.
- **Docker Client:** The command-line tool that allows the user to interact with the Docker Daemon.
- **Docker Images:** Read-only template used to start containers.
- **Docker Containers:** Runnable instances of Docker images.

#### Container Network Models
- **Bridge:** Default network mode where a private internal network is created on the host so containers can communicate.
- **Host:** Removes network isolation between the container and the Docker host, and uses the hostâ€™s networking directly.
- **Overlay:** Connects multiple Docker daemons together and enables swarm services to communicate with each other.
- **Macvlan:** Allows assigning a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your network.
